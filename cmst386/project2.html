        <h2>Mark Hester</h2>
        <h1>Website Proposal</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Convieniently located in Catonsville, Md, Culinary Craft Workshop is in need of a new, updated website. The prupose of the website is to increase their digital profile. This will not be a total rebranding effort.</p>
        <p>Culinary Craft Workshop's current website fails to capute the market share that the owner/operators hope for. The company hopes to correctly represent the value and experience that they offer. The also would like to maintain if not increase the culinary and skill instructions that they offer. Lastly, they would like to maintain the current logo and color palette. </p>
        <p>Testing of the website will be done in two phases. The first will be group testing. The second stage will be through one on one interviews. The purpose of this type of testing is to correctly pinpoint, understand and address any and all pain points presented.</p>
        <p>The group testing will be the first stage. This has proven to be an effective method of establishing a broad over view of how the website is recieved and works. This type of testing can be done in person or online.</p>
        <p>The interview stage allows the testors to focus in on problem areas or areas that need more attention. A more intimate one on one session allows the testors to gather deeper information and comprehension of the visitor's experience and thought process.</p>
        <P>Culinary Craft Workshop is a relatively new business. Being less than ten years old, they focus on professional cooking in a casual, relaxed and fun environment for kids and adult chefs of all ages and skill levels. Students can get hands on experience from professional level chefs and learn to cook dishes and meals from around the world.</P>
        <p>While an increased digital online presence and an effective growing social media presence, growth is inevitable. However the current website has proven to be not as effective as it should be. The word of mouth is feuled by current and former students. However as new students discover CCW their website should seal the deal by providing a more enticing, informative and alluring Call to Action. </p>
        <p>In terms of security, this will primarily be handled by the choosen web host. Potential students have the opportunity to select and register for one of the many classes they offer.</p>
        <p>Criteria for choosing the proper website will be developed at an early developer - client meeting. Initial criteria will include available band width, price, security, domain name ownership, scaleability, backups and backup schedules and number and locations of their servers.</p>
        <p>Leading candidates initially are Hostinger and Blue Horizon. Past experiences have been favorable for both client and developer. However both hosting companies may be overkill for a company that does business only in the Baltimore/Washington area. Other options may prove to be more effective.</p>
        <p>The focus of marketing will be through word of mouth. An email blast along with their already effective social media presence will bring more eyes to the website. Reaching out to the local media, both television and radio in both Baltimore and Washington D.C. can be a very lucrative effort and more than enough of a cash cow.</p>
